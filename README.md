As a non-native English speaker, books are an incredible source for me
to enrich my vocabulary. Sure, Movies, TV Shows, and Podcasts are also
valuable, but seldom I encounter new words in them... Whereas books
like *Infinite Jest*, *Blood Meridian*, *As I Lay Dying*, or *Gravity's
Rainbow*, pose for me not only the challenges that even native speakers
have to face, but they also use often words which are just at the edge
of my comprehension.

Motivated by this, I thought it would be cool to have a service that
takes an Ebook (for now I am working only on EPUB formatted books)
and returns a list of "characteristic" words contained in the book
together with their definitions. With characteristic here I mean words
which appear relatively frequently in the book with respect to some other
text corpus.

I hope this will be useful to someone else too; stay tuned :-)
